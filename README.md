# Facebook_Chatbot
It's a chatbot which reply based on your earlier conversation with that person.

In V-1.0 I have added feature of authentication of user.
For using this, just choose your Username while registering same as your first name in your facebook Account.
Like my facebook profile name is Satyendra pandey So I will register my username in this app as Satyendra.
Now First you have to download your facebook data from facebook settings, Then you have to upload your message.htm on url "/train".
After processing of your messages you will be redirected to "/" where you will see a chatbox. First Choose your Friends First name
(Like for Narendra Pandey I will put Narendra), Now type the message. And this bot will reply you accordingly.

NOTE -- You have to set MySQL database to run V-1.2, you can see a file at location Flask_v1.2/MySQL_setup which can assist you with MySQL.

Thanks
